The project aims to create a smart notification system using IoT, an ESP32 board, and an LCD 16x2 display. The system is designed to receive alert messages from a web application and display them on the LCD screen. The ESP32 board is connected to the internet via Wi-Fi and communicates with the web application using MQTT or HTTP protocols. The web application acts as the control center for sending notifications to the hardware.

The purpose of this project is to provide a real-time notification system that can display important alerts or messages on a physical device. By connecting the web application to the hardware, users can send notifications from the website, which are then received and displayed on the LCD screen. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as displaying weather updates, important announcements, system alerts, or any other information that requires immediate attention.

The system allows for seamless communication between the web application and the hardware, enabling users to send notifications from anywhere with an internet connection. The LCD display provides a visual interface for users to view the received messages. Additionally, user interaction is supported through buttons or switches on the hardware, allowing users to acknowledge or clear alerts directly from the device.

Overall, the project combines IoT, web development, and hardware integration to create a smart notification system with real-time message display capabilities. It enhances communication and enables users to stay informed through a physical device connected to the web application.
